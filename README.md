## Purpose
My goal is to provide efficient and effective user-interface and navigation option for the user to figure out the geolocation and basic information about the restaurant. It means my site not only creates a professional image for users, but also should be easy to use without thinking.
## Problem Statements
In this study, I conduct several usability testing to identify the problem before coding and test how the user actually intact with my site. The reasons of usability test have numerous goals:
- Realize if users are able to complete given tasks successfully via the laptop UI.
- Identify the time that participants need to take to complete given tasks.
- Figure out how user satisfied through the experience with this site.
- Review and analyze whether this site meets the implementations of Web Design & Usability Guidelines.

## User Profiles
The primary users will have a wide variety including students, faculties, residents and visitors in the Denver area from 15-65 year old. There is no specific requirement for the education level of the tester, but the other way to access this site will through the laptop device. Therefore, I expect the users have experience with the laptop device and familiar with the basic interface and usage of general browser. Moreover, I will use responsive web design templates such as jQuery and bootstrap to design the UI, which have already become familiar for general users.
## Methodology
The usability includes Objective and Subjective measurements to evaluate the performance of the website. Since this website will be accessed from a laptop, the subject will need to complete the tasks via the laptop version. In objective measurements, the tester will be assigned a set of task to complete for observer to record the timing, errors and clicks. Moreover, the observer might discover some unexpected interactions or barriers that tester encounter during the process. In subjective measurements, the subject will fill out a questionnaire about the user experience with the website and open-ended questions to provide suggestion and improvement.
## Test Environment and Equipment
The test will be conducted in a quiet room of the library at the University of Denver. The subject will sit in front a desk with a laptop using chrome browser. The observer will sit next to the participant, but with the distance that will not disrupt the test. The test facilitator will record the test via the stop clock application for the iPhone and a notebook to write down the unexpected interactions or result.
### Testing Crew
The testing crew includes one test facilitator who is responsible for the moderator, data logger, timer, and site specialist.
### Evaluation Measures
- The average time testers needed to complete each task.
- How many and what error happened during the task.
- The way tester prefers to complete the task.
- Subjective rating and open-ended questions.

## Discussion
This section provides the interpretation based on the result

Every subject successfully completed the tasks without making any error. The main differences between each subject are the way and the time to complete the tasks. Moreover, during the process, there are many interesting discoveries.

First of all, the task one is mainly to test whether the website provides enough hits for visitors to know where they are. Many of the testers could identify the answer via the logo design and the tagline. However, some subjects needed to go to the menu to figure out the food restaurant serve. This result shows a problem that some of the hints on the home page cannot efficiently deliver the style of the restaurant. The questionnaire ranking results show this problem as well, which the question two and four (the restaurant provides sufficient information and adequate tools) only got 4.4. Combining the task result with open-ended questions, many testers complain that the cover flow image is not informative and attractive enough. That means the information on home page does not informative enough to support user’s memorability to recall the related memory and image in order to complete the task one. Furthermore, this site does not create a very positive first impression for the visitor. This is a major usability issue requiring to be solved as soon as possible. This issue also is regulated in rule 5:3 (Create a Positive First Impression of Your Site) with 5 scores on importance.

The task two to five are ensured this site has well-organized information architecture and proper visual appearance (White space usage, Color choices). Overall results and answers in the questionnaire are positive. Nonetheless, there are some features offend the guideline causing deduction on visual appearance. Many of the comments mentioned that the home page is too long and be required to use vertical scrolling to view the whole. This problem has been regulated in rule 6:10 (Set Appropriate Page Lengths) and rule 8:5(Scroll Fewer Screenfuls). Moreover, this issue might cause the user miss the important information on the footer (Open hours, reservation phone number, and location).

The final key issue is that this web site still needs to enrich the information on the menu page and gallery page. From the open-ended answers and questionnaire result, we can see most of the testers expect more functions and detail on both pages. On the menu page, subjects expect to see the food ingredients, signifiers for vegan/ vegetarian and the images of the menu items. On the gallery page, testers expect to have the photo enlarged function and description about the photo. Although missing those features and functions do not interrupt the completion of the tasks, it is regulated in rule 1:3 (Understand and Meet User’s Expectations) and rule 1:4(Involve Users in Establishing User Requirements) which have a full score on importance. That means this website still misses some conventional features that the users assume a restaurant should have.
## Recommendations for Change
